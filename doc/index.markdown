## Some notes about markdown

Please name the files `filename.markdown`. The important bit is the `.markdown`
extension, as our converter script will look for files with that extension and
convert them to html.

To compile a file locally you have to install markdown (`apt-cache search
markdown`).

**Please do not commit the generated files into the repository!** The files
will be generated regularly on the server.

## Markdown syntax

Here you have a few examples to get you started, the complete documentation can
be found on the [markdown Homepage](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
